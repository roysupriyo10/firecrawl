description: Get Firecrawl credentials and SDK setup into a project. Use when an application needs `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`, when an agent should add Firecrawl to `.env`, when the user wants to authenticate Firecrawl for app code, or when choosing the first SDK and docs for a new Firecrawl integration. This skill includes its own browser auth flow, so it does not depend on the website onboarding skill.

# Firecrawl Build Onboarding

Use this skill for the application-integration path from Firecrawl's onboarding flow.

> **Fork note (roysupriyo10/firecrawl):** This copy is vendored into the monorepo and patched for self-host. Upstream SHA: see `firecrawl-skills/UPSTREAM_SKILLS_SHA`.

## Install (this monorepo)

```bash
npx skills add ./firecrawl-skills
# or
npx skills add https://github.com/roysupriyo10/firecrawl/tree/main/firecrawl-skills
```

Official cloud-only path (separate): `npx -y firecrawl-cli@latest init --all --browser`

## Use This When

- a project needs `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` (cloud) or `FIRECRAWL_API_URL` (self-host)
- the user wants Firecrawl wired into `.env`
- you are adding Firecrawl to an app for the first time
- you need to choose the first SDK or REST path

If the human still needs to sign up, sign in, or authorize **cloud** access in the browser, use the auth flow reference in this skill.

## Quick Start

### Cloud

```dotenv
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...
```

### Self-host (this fork)

```dotenv
FIRECRAWL_API_URL=http://localhost:3002
# API key optional when USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false
```

For LLM extract on the server itself (not the client SDK), the **server** `.env` uses `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` + `MODEL_PROVIDER=google` + `MODEL_NAME=...` — see [firecrawl-selfhost-llm](../firecrawl-selfhost-llm/SKILL.md).

Then decide which integration path applies:

- **Fresh project** -> choose the target stack, install the SDK, add the first Firecrawl call, and run a smoke test
- **Existing project** -> inspect the repo first, then integrate Firecrawl where the project already handles third-party APIs and env vars

## What Do You Need?

| Task | Reference |
|---|---|
| **Run the browser auth flow and save `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`** | [references/auth-flow.md](references/auth-flow.md) |
| **Install the right SDK** | [references/sdk-installation.md](references/sdk-installation.md) |
| **Put credentials into `.env` or project config** | [references/project-setup.md](references/project-setup.md) |
| **Choose the right endpoint after setup** | [firecrawl-build](../firecrawl-build/SKILL.md) |
| **Need live web tooling during this task** | The CLI skills are already installed from the same command |
| **Start implementation from a known URL** | [firecrawl-build-scrape](../firecrawl-build-scrape/SKILL.md) |
| **Start implementation from a query** | [firecrawl-build-search](../firecrawl-build-search/SKILL.md) |

## Docs (Source of Truth)

Read the source-of-truth page for your project language for SDK usage, schemas, and examples:

- **Node / TypeScript**: [docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/node](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/node)
- **Python**: [docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/python](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/python)
- **Rust**: [docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/rust](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/rust)
- **Java**: [docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/java](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/java)
- **Elixir**: [docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/elixir](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/elixir)
- **cURL / REST**: [docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/curl](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/agent-source-of-truth/curl)

## After Setup

Once the key is present:

1. decide whether this is a fresh project or an existing codebase
2. ask what Firecrawl should do in the product
3. pick the narrowest endpoint that matches that behavior
4. read the source-of-truth page for the project language before writing code
5. add the SDK or REST call in code
6. run a smoke test that proves one real Firecrawl request succeeds
7. use the endpoint-specific skills in this repo for implementation guidance
8. if you also need live web tooling during the current task, the CLI skills are already installed — use `firecrawl/cli`
